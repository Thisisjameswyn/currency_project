# Currency Exchange

### Description

This is my sixth week project for Epicodus. The objective is to take a given currency value and convert to a selected country's value using current data retrieved from https://www.exchangerate-api.com/. The form should allow for the selection of two countries and an amount to exchange, then return the converted value back to the user.

This program requires an API key which can be obtained here https://www.exchangerate-api.com/. Once you have your key you can put it in the .env file as described in the instructions.
